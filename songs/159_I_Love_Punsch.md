I love punsch in bites of three
I love the punsch bottle and it loves me
Arrack and tea, makes the punsch just for me
A shot, a shot, a shot, a shot, a shot

I love punsch filling my cup
I love the golden drops, I lick 'em up
Now flip the cup and punsch lovers drink up
A shot, a shot, a shot, a shot, a shot
