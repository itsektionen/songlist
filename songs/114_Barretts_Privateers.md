Kan sjungas med sångledare, då sjunger alla raderna som börjar med "\*", sångledaren i

O the year was 17-78!
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
A letter of marque came from the king,
to the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen!

\*God damn them all!
\*I was told we'd cruise the seas for american gold!
\*We'd fire no guns, shed no tears!
\*Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
\*the last of Barrett's privateers.

O Elcid Barrett cried the town.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
For twenty brave men, all fishermen who
would make for him the Antelope's crew.

\*God damn them all ...

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
and the cook in the scuppers
with the staggers and jags!

\*God damn them all ...

On the king's birthday we put to sea.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay,
pumping like madmen all the way.

\*God damn them all ...

On 96th day we sailed again.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great yankee hove in sight,
with our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.

\*God damn them all ...

The yankee lay low down with gold.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays,
but to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.

\*God damn them all ...

Then at length we stood, two cables away.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din,
but with one fat ball the yank stove us in.

\*God damn them all ...

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs,
and the main-truck carried off both me legs.

*God damn them all!
*I was told we'd cruise the seas for american gold!
*We'd fire no guns, shed no tears!
*Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
\*the last of Barrett's privateers.

Now here I lay in my 23rd year.
\*How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been six long years since we sailed away,
and I just made Halifax yesterday.

\*God damn them all ...
