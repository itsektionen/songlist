I want more 
You want mooo–ree 
We all want a little moo–ore 
Come on let’s raise our glass 
Take a sip 
And drink a little bit 

Sitting here and my mouth is dry 
I think I know exactly whyyy 
Looking at my glass there 
Liquid is inside 
That’s gonna change tonight 

Maybe it’s tradition 
Maybe it’s superstition 
But why do we take sips here 
Why not just the shot 
I want to drink a lot 

But there’s too many songs 

Why is this place like this 
Such odd rules 
I am so confused oh yeah 
Weird ass rules 
I don’t knooow 
What I am supposed to dooo 

I want more 
You want mooo–ree 
We all want a little moo–ore 
Come on let’s raise our glass 
Take a sip 
And drink a little bit
