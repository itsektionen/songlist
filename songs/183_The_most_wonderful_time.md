It’s the most wonderful time of the gasque
When the spirits are high  
and the bellies are full and the punsch has been served
It’s the most wonderful time of the gasque

It is time for us to start drinking punsch
We all say skål and let  
golden drops flow all the way down our throats
It is time for us to start drinking puu-unsch
