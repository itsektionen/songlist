The liquor store I dash towards
And bang upon its door.
I want something that burns real fast,
And gets me drunk for sure.
The clerk then asked me, bold and loud:
"How old are you, to be so proud?"
"Got some ID, you scruffy kid?
Come back when you can grow a beard!"

No, this won't do, it's not my night,
I'm getting drunk today!
But then a brilliant thought struck me -
There's booze at Shell, hooray!
The bottles stood there in a row,
Now I'll get drunk and let it flow.
The red drink poured way down my throat,
Now I can't see a thing, you know.
