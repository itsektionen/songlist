title: Punsch is coming
author:
melody: Vals ur Glada änkan
composer: Franz Lehár
notes:
  - Repeats until all the punsch is served. Only those who have not been served sing.
    - For each repetition, a movement follows; rocking left to right, rocking back and forth, standing up and sitting down. These are repeated as long as you sing.
    - This is an English translation of "Punschen kommer"

Punsch is coming, Punsch is coming  
Sweet and cool.
Glasses fogging, voices buzzing,
In our hall.

Skål to joyful mem’ries,
Skål to every spring,
No more sorrows will remain
When punsch they bring.
