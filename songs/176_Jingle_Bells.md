Raising our glass, and seeing it's not clear
wondering what we can do to make it disappear
Skål we say to all, and lift our glasses high
It's time to finish our job and drink the punsch tonight, oh

Let's drink punsch, drink more punsch
Drink it all the time
Oh how tasty punsch does taste
These golden drops of mine - HEY

Let's drink punsch, drink more punsch
Drink it all the time
Oh how tasty punsch does taste
These golden drops of mine
