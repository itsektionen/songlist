I’m beginning to have a little problem
I am getting bored
I don’t know what I should do
And no one has a clue
Is it time for me to wonder ‘bout the food?

I'm beginning to feel a little hungry
Where's some food to eat
I’ve been waiting for far too long
Now I have to sing this song
Pleading from my seat

A plate of delicious food
and a whiskey to boot
is the need that I want fulfilled
but all that I have is this meagre old glass
that looks like it was in the dirt
But all I say is I don’t care
as long as I have fun

I'm beginning to feel a little thirsty
Time to drink some more
So raise your beer and give a cheer
And then hold all your friends near
And sing this song to pass away the time

I’m beginning to feel the joy returning
Singing fills the air
With a friend who’s by my side
And a good drink to abide
I have not a care
