When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up with my beer
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who orders us some beer
If I get drunk, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk off of beer
And if I throw up, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's throwin’ up some beer

[Chorus]
But I would drink five hundred beers
And I would drink five hundred more
Just to be the man who drank a thousand
Beers before I drank some mooo-oore

When I'm workin', yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's workin' hard for beer
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll spend almost every krona on more beer
When I come home (When I come home), oh, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who drinks some shower beer
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's always drinkin’ beer

[Chorus]
But I would drink five hundred beers
And I would drink five hundred more
Just to be the man who drank a thousand
Beers before I drank some mooo-oore

[Post-Chorus]

Da-da da da (Da-da da da)
Da-da da da (Da-da da da)
Da-da dum diddy dum diddy dum diddy da da da
