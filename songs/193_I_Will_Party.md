I will party, take it slow with drinking. 
Have some fun without getting too drunk. 
Not crawling 'round with the party crowd. 
Take it easy, relax for my own sake 

First a beer to quench my thirst, 
Then a shot, you know what’s first. 
Down the wine, then punsch in line, 
A cocktail buffet last. 

Now I’m wasted, pass out first of all, 
Miss the party, but who really cares? 
Mixing beer and old sour milk for kicks, 
Throwing up on my dinner mate there! 

First a beer to quench my thirst, 
Then a shot, you know what’s first. 
Down the wine, then punsch in line, 
A cocktail buffet last. 

Vomit’s flowing down my woolen tie, 
Ravioli’s drying in my hair. 
Who put me here in this damn urinal? 
And whose fork is stuck in my right thigh?
