A viking loves the joys of life,
hurra, hurra!
They’re quickly running down his throat,  
hurra, hurra!
With veal, with ox, with fish, with pork,
Vikings never use a fork,
Vikings only want to pop the cork.

The bäsk eventually runs out,
oh no, oh no!
Every viking’s carried out  
yo ho, yo ho!
And when we wake up, we sing a just a bit,
and open a bottle of Akvavit,
||: Skål to every :|| viking that took the hit.
