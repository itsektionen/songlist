In the trade of jester,
we're fools that play our part.
In an act sworn by folklore,
where the lines are made by heart.

Getting gold from the nobles
and mockin' from ye all.
But we drink with the greatest warriors,
and we dance in every hall.

We travel through the country,
we go from town to town.
We're the sworn kings of jester
but we've never worn a crown.

Getting gold ...

I've never had a family,
nor have I had a wife.
It's a high cost of living,
it's the price I pay for life.

Getting gold ...

We meet the fairest ladies,
but we never had a chance.
So we play our bagpipes
as the common people dance.

> "Säckpipor"

To die without a nickel
is a scare for anyone.
So we work until our last day,
and we die like common man.

Getting gold ...
