Please start the gasque now
I'm reaching for my flask now
All this waiting is making me think

My thirst is consuming,
my hunger is still fuming
For fuck sake, give me something to drink!

All this mayhem! Please just stop them
Who the fuck thinks that I am a moose?

To England on horseback,
while chugging down a six pack
I am sure that we'll find us a pub

And there we will party,
with some guy named Marty
Let's drink whisky and port wine,
and act like a real swine
we'll try all the rubb and the stubb!
