Please start the gasque now
I’m reaching for my flask now
All this waiting is making me think
My thirst is consuming
my hunger is still fuming
For fuck sake, give me something to drink
All this mayhem, please just stop them
Who the fuck thinks that I am a mo-o-ose

To England on horseback
While chugging down a six pack
I am sure that we’ll find us a pu-u-ub
And there we will party
With some guy named Marty
Let’s drink whisky and port wine
And act like a real swine
We’ll try all the rubb and the stu-u-ubb
