Farewell and adieu to you danish ladies
Farewell and adieu to you lovely Danes
For we’re under orders to sail off to England
We hope in a short time to see you again

We’ll rant and we’ll roar like true viking raiders
We’ll plunder the shores along the north sea
Until we strike soundings in the channel o’ England
From Valland to London ‘tis forty-five leagues

We hove our ship to, with the wind from sou’west, crew.
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take.
‘Twas twenty-one fathoms, with a murky mud bottom
And bore right away, crew, and up river did make.

We’ll rant and we’ll roar...

We pull out our ships, gettin’ hold of our weapons.
We pull out our ships, preparing to raid.
Our sights set on London, to get all of ’er gold.
When we find the old city, we leave her in flames.

We’ll rant and we’ll roar...

Now let every man drink off his full bumper
And let every man drink off his full glass
We’ll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy
Here’s to the health of each true-hearted lass

We’ll rant and we’ll roar...
