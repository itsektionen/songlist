He's a real UNIX Man,
sitting in his UNIX LAN,
making all his UNIX .plans
for nobody.

Knows the blocksize from 'du'.
Cares not where /dev/null goes to.
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

UNIX Man, don't worry.
It's the tube that's blurry.
UNIX Man,
the new kernel boots,
just like you had planned.

He's as wise as he can be.
Programs in lex, yacc and C.
UNIX Man, can you help me at all?

UNIX Man, please listen.
My printout is missin'.
UNIX Man,
the wo-o-o-orld is your 'at' command.
